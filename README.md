Python script and shell.\

      - Excel sheet must be in correct placment as seen in TestSS\
      - PDF files must be in the main directory (Inplementation to avoid this restriction planned)\
      - Only works with Gmail. Gmail will block sign in attempts from apps that dont use modern security standards.\
      - To use this code enable less secure sign in here: https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps. Furthermore, this should be done on a seperate non crucial email with no sensitive data.
